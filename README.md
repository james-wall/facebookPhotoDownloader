# What is the problem?
It is a huge pain to retrieve large groups of photos from a Facebook account, particularly filtered sets (i.e. only photos with particular people) for purposes such as storing on a local machine or printing.

# Why is the problem important?
Many people use Facebook, Instagram, and similar platforms as modern day photo albums. All photos are kept and organized on these platforms. However, it is immensely difficult to download large batches of these photos to individual devices or to print them out.

# How are we addressing the problem?
A script to download photos from an individual Facebook account to your local machine

Proposed features:
- download by date range
- specify number of photos downloaded
- filter by person tagged in photo

Potential Future Scope: 
- Upload batches of photos from the command line 
- Extend to Instagram
- Send photos to physical printing service (i.e. personal printer or online service like CVS, Walgreens, etc.)

Dependencies:
pip install facebook-sdk
pip install requests

# When
I will be working on this personal project in my free time when I have an hour or so here and there. Exact timeline is TBD
